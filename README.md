## About Iban Syahdien Akbar

Hi, Introduce me Iban Syahdan Akbar.

I graduated from Gunadarma University, I majored in information systems, I learned about website-based programming and how to create structures that are used. Therefore, I am very interested in learning more about designing and building so that I can find out what is needed by a web-based application sequentially. 

To solve a problem on such a web-based application, I have experience in creating and designing through several projects, all done by defining various stakeholder requirements, conducting interviews with users so I can get their insights, learn from them, and turn them into ideas. which will provide a better experience for them. 

Apart from learning about Website-Based Programming, I don't limit myself to learning other things related to my major such as analysis and design of information systems and database systems. 

I can handle working with different types of people to create new experiences and learn new perspectives, I can work in a team or individually, I also want to learn more about the work I will be working on in the future.
