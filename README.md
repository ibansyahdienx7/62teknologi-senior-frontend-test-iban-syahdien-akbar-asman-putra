## About Iban Syahdien Akbar

Hi, Introduce me Iban Syahdan Akbar.

I graduated from Gunadarma University, I majored in information systems, I learned about website-based programming and how to create structures that are used. Therefore, I am very interested in learning more about designing and building so that I can find out what is needed by a web-based application sequentially. 

To solve a problem on such a web-based application, I have experience in creating and designing through several projects, all done by defining various stakeholder requirements, conducting interviews with users so I can get their insights, learn from them, and turn them into ideas. which will provide a better experience for them. 

Apart from learning about Website-Based Programming, I don't limit myself to learning other things related to my major such as analysis and design of information systems and database systems. 

I can handle working with different types of people to create new experiences and learn new perspectives, I can work in a team or individually, I also want to learn more about the work I will be working on in the future.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
